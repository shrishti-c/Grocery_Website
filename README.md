#About
An online Grocery Store permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or services from a store that serves both walk-in customers and online customers. 

The online Store system presents an online display of all the items they want to sell. This web based application helps customers to choose their daily needs and add products to their shopping cart. This Web application saves lots of time of customers.

Here, customer needs to register on the website portal and their information will be stored in database. If user is not registered they will not be able to login into the system. After signing up and logging in, user can visit the website and select the product from the displayed one in their cart. After adding product in the cart user can pay and checkout and exit from the website.

In case user is not registered in the website and still trying to login in the website, they will be redirected to the error page that would ask them to sign up or login again with correct credentials.

User will have the facility to increase the quantity of the product added in cart in the cart page and even remove them from the cart. 

When user will proceed to pay, the user will prompted with the confirm box to proceed with the payment. If user refuses then the product will remain in the cart else the item added in the cart will be removed as the order has been placed for the item and thank you message will be displayed. 

There are Terms and Conditions page and FAQ page too for the user to get aware with the policy of the company and to resolve the most common enquiries that customers often have.

There’s a cart button at the top that will always show the no of items that are added in the cart.

The website has been made responsive so that the website can be viewed easily on all the devices easily.








#Technology used
•	HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that I used to structure my web page and its content. I’ve added all the content in my website through HTML.

•	CSS: CSS is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. Whereas HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics. HTML is a markup language, and CSS is a style sheet language.


•	JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

•	MONGODB: MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
